Summary: What this app is trying to do...bring new parents together. This app is designed to have new parents to 
share their children's questions. It could be something that they know the answer and ones that they don't know the
answer to at all. This would encourage the ideal of this quote: "There is no such thing as a stupid question". 
I felt that new parents often bombarded with how to care for their kids or how to raise them but none "social media 
for new parents". Our children's questions are always full of surprises, which I am sure of it. 

This app entailed: HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, MongoDB, Heroku, mLab, Mocha/Chai, Node.js, and JWT.
